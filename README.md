# MusicPlayer
Desktop music player for all my unsorted MP3 files. A user will be able to organize and play MP3 files hosted on the server.

As the purpose of this is in part to practice my development skills, I will design the architecture to allow me to try a bunch of different stuff (e.g. perhaps a relational database isn't strictly necessary to store playlists but its useful for practice)


Additional Tools used
- Visual studio for development
- Postman to test POST requests
- DB Browser for SQL lite for formulating queries

To Do
- add hovers for songs with long names
- env file for port number and other variables
- make it look nice in chrome, safari
- persist current song/queue when refreshed and sensible defaults
- stylized modal instead of alert/prompt
- update playlist length when adding song if window is in view.
- ignore capitalization in song search ordering

Testing
- API
- UI
