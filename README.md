# MusicPlayer
Desktop music player for all my unsorted MP3 files. A user will be able to add and remove MP3 files locally, organize and play them.

As the purpose of this is in part to practice my development skills, I will design the architecture to allow me to try a bunch of different stuff.

Plan:
- MP3s will be stored in a local folder but their file paths will be tracked with a DB 
- This will also track other information such as playlists and artists
- The application will make API calls to retrieve this information
- The application will simply be accessed through a web browser, locally hosted, as I am to practice UI test automation on it in the future.
